Identification

Pattern used: Facade

Location of code: Processor
	
The Processor class provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in the system - the simple, default view of the subsystem that is good enough for most clients - and also provides layering and separation of subsystems. 





The Processor class knows which subsystem classes are responsible for a request, and delegates client requests to appropriate subsystem objects.
